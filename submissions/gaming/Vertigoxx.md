## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: BattleRealms zkArena
- **Category**: gaming

### Description
BattleRealms zkArena is a PvP blockchain-based game where players can battle, collect NFT characters, and build verifiable on-chain reputations.
The problem it solves: traditional online games rely on centralized servers, leading to issues with cheating, lack of transparency, and no true asset ownership. With zk-proofs and on-chain storage, matches and achievements become trustless and tamper-proof.

### SL Integration  
Utilize Soundness Layer zk-proofs to verify match outcomes without requiring centralized trust.

Player statistics, winrates, and inventories are recorded on Soundness Layer, ensuring transparency and verifiability.

Integration with the SL identity module allows players to carry their reputation across multiple games within the ecosystem.

## Technical

### Architecture
Client (Web + Mobile) → communicates with backend game server → validates gameplay results via Soundness Layer zk-proofs.

Smart contracts on Soundness Layer handle battle outcomes, reputation tracking, and rewards distribution.

Assets and metadata are stored in decentralized storage for permanence and accessibility.

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind
- **Backend**: Node.js + Rust for core game logic  
- **Blockchain**: SL + EVM-compatible sidechain for NFTs
- **Storage**: WALRUS for player data, IPFS for game assets

### Features
1. PvP battle system with zk-verifiable match results
2. NFT-based characters and tradable in-game items  
3. On-chain leaderboard powered by SL identity reputation
